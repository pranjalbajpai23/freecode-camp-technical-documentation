                <p>This is a technical documentation on front-end Web Development which include HTML,CSS  and JavaScript.
                Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice ofproducing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a usercan see and interact with them directly. The challenge associated with front enddevelopment is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of awebsite change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing. </p>
                <br>
                <p>The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the site they see the information in a format that is easy to read and relevant. This is further complicated by the fact that users now use a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into consideration these aspects when designing the site. </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                They need to ensure that their site comes up correctly in different browsers (cross-browser), different operating systems (cross-platform) and different devices (cross-device), which requires careful planning on the side of the developer.

                <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within tag which defines the structure of web pages.
                <br><br>
                HTML is a markup language that is used by the browser to manipulate text, images, and other content to display it in the required format.
                <br><br>
                <p>The HTML <code>button</code> tag defines a clickable button.<br> 
               <code>figure </code><code> div</code><code> span</code> are the mostly used tags</p>

                  <p>The CSS <code>background-color</code> property defines the background color of an element.</p>

         <article>
            JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted scripting language.
             It is well-known for the development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it.
              JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments.
               JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core 
               set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements. 
               <ul>
                  <li>Client-side: </li>
                  It supplies objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). Like if client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation. Useful libraries for the client-side are AngularJS, ReactJS, VueJS and so many others.
                  <li>Server-side:</li>
                  It supplies objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. Like if the server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, and provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server. The useful framework which is the most famous these days is node.js.

      <header>Elements and Tag in Html</header>
      <article>
         HTML uses predefined tags and elements which tell the browser how to properly display the content. Remember to include closing tags. If omitted, the browser applies the effect of the opening tag until the end of the page.

   <header>HTML page structure</header>
   <article>
      The basic structure of an HTML page is laid out below. It contains the essential building-block elements (i.e. doctype declaration, HTML, head, title, and body elements) upon which all web pages are created.
         <img src="Images/htmlstruct.png" alt=""><br><br>
        DOCTYPE! html: This is the document type declaration (not technically a tag). It declares a document as being an HTML document. The doctype declaration is not case-sensitive. <br><br>
        html: This is called the HTML root element. All other elements are contained within it.<br><br>

         head: The head tag contains the “behind the scenes” elements for a webpage. Elements within the head aren't visible on the front-end of a webpage. HTML elements used inside the head element include: 
         <ul>
            <li>style</li>
            <li>title</li>
            <li>noscript</li>
            <li>script</li>
            <li>base</li>
            <li>meta</li>
         </ul>
         body: The body tag is used to enclose all the visible content of a webpage. In other words, the body content is what the browser will show on the front-end.

            An HTML document can be created using any text editor. Save the text file using .html or .htm. Once saved as an HTML document, the file can be opened as a webpage in the browser.
            <br><br>
            
            Note: Basic/built-in text editors are Notepad (Windows) and TextEdit (Macs). Basic text editors are entirely sufficient for when you're just getting started. As you progress, there are many feature-rich text editors available which allow for greater function and flexibility.

   <header>Why use CSS?</header>
   <article>
      CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.
         <ul>
            <li>CSS Solved a Big Problem</li>
               HTML was NEVER intended to contain tags for formatting a web page!
               
               HTML was created to describe the content of a web page, like:
               
               <h1 style="font-size: medium;">This is a heading</h1>
               
               <p style="font-size: medium;">This is a paragraph.</p>
               
               When tags like font, and color attributes were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it started a nightmare for web developers. Development of large websites, where fonts and color information were added to every single page, became a long and expensive process.
               
               To solve this problem, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created CSS.
               
               CSS removed the style formatting from the HTML page!
               <li>CSS Saves a Lot of Work!</li>
               The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files.
                  With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

   <header>How to use JavaScript?</header>
   <article>
      JavaScript can be added to your HTML file in two ways:
      <ul>
     <li> Internal JS: We can add JavaScript directly to our HTML file by writing the code inside the script tag. The script tag can either be placed inside the head or the body tag according to the requirement.
     </li>
      <li>External JS: We can write JavaScript code in other file having an extension .js and then link this file inside the head tag of the HTML file in which we want to add this code.</li>

   <header>Applications of JavaScript</header>
   <article>
         <ul>
           <li> Web Development:</li> Adding interactivity and behavior to static sites JavaScript was invented to do this in 1995. By using AngularJS that can be achieved so easily.
<br><br><li>Web Applications:</li> With technology, browsers have improved to the extent that a language was required to create robust web applications. When we explore a map in Google Maps then we only need to click and drag the mouse. All detailed view is just a click away, and this is possible only because of JavaScript. It uses Application Programming Interfaces(APIs) that provide extra power to the code. The Electron and React is helpful in this department.
<br><br><li>Server Applications:</li> With the help of Node.js, JavaScript made its way from client to server and node.js is the most powerful on the server-side.
<br><br><li>Games:</li> Not only in websites, but JavaScript also helps in creating games for leisure. The combination of JavaScript and HTML 5 makes JavaScript popular in game development as well. It provides the EaseJS library which provides solutions for working with rich graphics.
 JavaScript is being used in all possible devices and applications. It provides a library PebbleJS which is used in smartwatch applications. This framework works for applications that require the internet for its functioning.
 <br><br><li>Art:</li> Artists and designers can create whatever they want using JavaScript to draw on HTML 5 canvas, make the sound more effective also can be used p5.js library.
 <br><br><li>Machine Learning:</li> This JavaScript ml5.js library can be used in web development by using machine learning.

<section class="selction" id="Limitations_java">
   <header>Limitations of JavaScript</header>
   <article>
         <ul>
            <li>Performance:</li>JavaScript does not provide the same level of performance as offered by many traditional languages as a complex program written in JavaScript would be comparatively slow. But as JavaScript is used to perform simple tasks in a browser, so performance is not considered a big restriction in its use.
            <br><br><li>Complexity:</li> To master a scripting language, programmers must have a thorough knowledge of all the programming concepts, core language objects, client and server-side objects otherwise it would be difficult for them to write advanced scripts using JavaScript.
            <br><br><li>Weak error handling and type checking facilities:</li> It is weakly typed language as there is no need to specify the data type of the variable. So wrong type checking is not performed by compile.
